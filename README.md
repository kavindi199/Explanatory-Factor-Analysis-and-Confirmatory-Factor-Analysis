This project involves performing Explanatory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) on a dataset of gas turbine sensor measurements. 
The dataset, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, consists of 36,733 instances and 11 sensor measures aggregated over one hour. 
The primary objective is to study flue gas emissions, specifically carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), from a gas turbine located in Turkey. 
By applying EFA, we identify underlying relationships between measured variables, and through CFA, we confirm the factor structures suggested by EFA. 
The repository includes data files, R scripts, R Markdown notebooks, CSV files. 
The project setup requires R, RStudio, and specific R packages ("tidyverse", "psych", "lavaan").
